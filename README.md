# Diorite
An industry-grade desktop maths environment that runs in the CL or a GUI. Designed for high-level mathematics, for
professional mathematicians.

## IMPORTANT
This software is primarily for Windows as the bundled IDE uses WPF on the .NET platform, but you can still use the interpreter/compiler software on Linux systems perfectly fine.
