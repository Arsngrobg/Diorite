# Diorite
An industry-grade desktop maths environment that runs in the terminal or a GUI interface.

## IMPORTANT
This software is primarily for Windows as the bundled IDE uses WPF on the .NET platform, but you can still use the interpreter/compiler software on Linux systems perfectly fine.

# Base Requirements
- [ ] Interpreter (F#)
  - [ ] Interpreting and executing arithmetic expressions
  - [ ] Variable assignment
  - [ ] Variable usage in expressions
- [ ] IDE (C#)

# Ideas
- LSP (probably as we write the IDE)
- Arbitrary-size integers/doubles in umbrella as Number type [reference](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-8-how-python-integers-work)
- Wiki (GH Pages, on a separate branch)
- Transpile to C (optional as the document states)
