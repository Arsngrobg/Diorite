# Diorite
A language written in F#. It comes bundled with an IDE written for development in this language.

## IMPORTANT
This software is primarily for Windows as the bundled IDE uses winform on the .NET platform, but you can still use the interpreter/compiler software on Linux systems perfectly fine.

# Base Requirements
- [ ] Interpreter (F#)
- [ ] IDE (C#)

# Ideas
- LSP (probably as we write the IDE)
- Wiki (GH Pages, on a seperate branch)
- Transpile to C (optional as the document states)
